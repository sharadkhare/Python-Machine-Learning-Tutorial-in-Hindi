# Machine learning is making the computer to learn from studying data and statistics. this is a program that analyses data and learns tp predict the outcome.

# Where to start: here for calucation important numbers based on data sets we use mathematics and for studying statistics. and using the vairous python modules.
# Data Set: [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

# Data Type: there are three types of main category of data type in ML.:
# Numerical: 1) Discrete Data: numbers that are limited to integer like number of cars passing by a road. 2) Continuous Data: Number that are of infinite value like price of an item.
# Categorical Data: the values that cannot be count or measured like color.
# Ordinal Data: these are like categorical data but can be measured or countable like school grades where A is better than B.
